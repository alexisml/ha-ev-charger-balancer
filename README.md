# EV Charger Load Balancing (HACS)

A custom Home Assistant integration (HACS) that provides dynamic load balancing for EV chargers, using a power meter and the lbbrhzn/ocpp integration.

This project gives Home Assistant users a native, no-helper-required solution to limit charging current to an EV charger based on a whole-home power meter, household limits, and user preferences.

---

> ⚠️ **Current limitation (PR-1):** This integration currently supports **one charger per instance**. Multiple-charger support with per-charger prioritization is planned for Phase 2 (post-MVP). Multiple instances of this integration are not supported — only one config entry can be created. See the [MVP plan](docs/documentation/milestones/01-2026-02-19-mvp-plan.md) and the [multi-charger plan](docs/documentation/milestones/02-2026-02-19-multi-charger-plan.md) for details.

Status: In development — custom integration (PR-1 through PR-6-MVP complete; working toward PR-7-MVP: HACS release)

## Why a custom integration?

During prototyping we evaluated AppDaemon apps and automation blueprints as potential delivery mechanisms. Both were rejected for the same reason: **every runtime-configurable parameter (service current, voltage, charger limits, enable toggle) must be a manually created `input_number` / `input_boolean` helper** because neither AppDaemon nor blueprints can create Config Entries in HA.

A **custom HACS integration with Config Flow** solves this:

- **No manual helper creation** — the user configures everything through Settings → Integrations → Add (a guided UI).
- **Native HA entities** — the integration registers `number`, `switch`, `sensor`, and `binary_sensor` entities linked to a proper device in Settings → Devices.
- **Persistent state** — config entries and entity states survive HA restarts.
- **Multi-charger support** *(planned)* — future options flow will handle adding/removing chargers at runtime; currently one charger per instance only.
- **HACS distribution** — install via HACS, configure in the UI, no YAML required.

See [`docs/development-memories/2026-02-19-lessons-learned.md`](docs/development-memories/2026-02-19-lessons-learned.md) for the full evaluation.

## How it works

### Inputs

| Input | Description |
|---|---|
| **Service voltage** (V) | Nominal supply voltage — used to convert power (W) ↔ current (A) |
| **Service current** (A) | Maximum whole-house breaker rating; the system never exceeds this |
| **Power meter** (W) | Real-time total household consumption, including active EV charging |
| **Max charger current** (A) | Per-charger upper limit; can be changed at runtime |
| **Min EV current** (A) | Lowest current at which the charger can operate (IEC 61851: 6 A); below this charging must stop |
| **Ramp-up time** (s) | Cooldown before allowing current to increase after a dynamic reduction (default 30 s) |
| **Unavailable behavior** | What to do when the power meter is unavailable: **stop** (default), **ignore**, or **set current** |
| **Fallback current** (A) | Charging current to use in "set current" mode — capped at the charger maximum to prevent exceeding the physical limit |
| **Actions** | User-supplied scripts: `set_current`, `stop_charging`, `start_charging` — see the [Action Scripts Guide](docs/documentation/action-scripts-guide.md) |
| **Event notifications** | HA bus events fired on fault conditions (meter unavailable, overload, fallback, charging resumed) — see the [Event Notifications Guide](docs/documentation/event-notifications-guide.md) |

---

### Decision loop

The balancer is **event-driven** — it does not poll on a timer. A recomputation is triggered by any of the following events:

| Trigger event | What happens | Latency |
|---|---|---|
| **Power meter state change** | The configured `sensor.*` entity reports a new Watt value. The coordinator reads it and runs the full balancing algorithm. | Instant — runs on the same HA event-loop tick as the state change. |
| **Max charger current changed** | The user (or an automation) changes the `number.max_charger_current` entity. The coordinator re-reads the current power meter value and recomputes immediately. | Instant — no need to wait for the next meter event. |
| **Min EV current changed** | Same as above for `number.min_ev_current`. If the new minimum is higher than the current target, charging stops on this tick. | Instant. |
| **Load balancing re-enabled** | The `switch.enabled` entity is turned back on. The coordinator reads the current power meter value and runs a full recomputation. | Instant. |

> **Note:** When the `switch.enabled` entity is turned **off**, power-meter events are ignored and no recomputation occurs. The charger current is left at its last value until load balancing is re-enabled.

On each trigger, the coordinator runs the following logic:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A([Power meter changes])
    A --> B["Compute available headroom<br/>available_a = service_current_a - house_power_w / voltage_v"]
    B --> C["target_a = min(current_ev_a + available_a, max_charger_a)<br/>floor to 1 A step"]
    C --> D{"target_a &lt; min_ev_a?"}
    D -- YES --> E(["stop_charging — instant<br/>charger OFF"])
    D -- NO --> F{"target_a &lt; current_a?<br/>load increased, must reduce"}
    F -- "YES — instant" --> G(["set_current(target_a)"])
    F -- "NO — load decreased" --> H{"ramp-up cooldown elapsed?<br/>time since last reduction ≥ ramp_up_time_s"}
    H -- "YES — allowed" --> I(["set_current(target_a)"])
    H -- NO --> J(["hold current<br/>wait and retry next cycle"])
```

---

### Charger state transitions

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "CHARGING (current = target_a)" as CHARGING
    state "STOPPED (charger off)" as STOPPED

    [*] --> STOPPED
    CHARGING --> STOPPED: target_a < min_ev_a — instant
    STOPPED --> CHARGING: target_a ≥ min_ev_a AND ramp-up elapsed (or first start)

    note right of STOPPED
        Resume: start_charging() then set_current(target_a)
    end note
```

Key rules:
- **Reductions are always instant** — the moment household load rises above the limit, the charger current is reduced on the very next power-meter event.
- **Increases are held for `ramp_up_time_s`** after any reduction — this prevents rapid oscillation when load hovers near the service limit.
- **Stopping charging** happens when even the minimum current would exceed the service limit.
- **Resuming charging** happens when the available current rises back above the minimum threshold and the ramp-up cooldown has elapsed.

---

### Balancer operational states

The integration exposes a diagnostic sensor (`sensor.*_balancer_state`) that tracks the coordinator's operational state on every cycle. These states map to the decision loop and charger transitions above:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "STOPPED\ntarget = 0 A" as STOPPED
    state "ADJUSTING\ntarget changed" as ADJUSTING
    state "ACTIVE\nsteady state" as ACTIVE
    state "RAMP_UP_HOLD\ncooldown blocking increase" as RAMP_UP_HOLD
    state "DISABLED\nswitch off" as DISABLED

    [*] --> STOPPED
    STOPPED --> ADJUSTING : headroom ≥ min_ev_a
    ADJUSTING --> ACTIVE : same target next cycle
    ADJUSTING --> STOPPED : overload (target < min_ev_a)
    ADJUSTING --> RAMP_UP_HOLD : increase needed but cooldown active
    ACTIVE --> ADJUSTING : target changed
    ACTIVE --> STOPPED : overload
    ACTIVE --> RAMP_UP_HOLD : increase needed but cooldown active
    RAMP_UP_HOLD --> ADJUSTING : cooldown elapsed
    RAMP_UP_HOLD --> STOPPED : overload
    DISABLED --> STOPPED : re-enabled (no headroom)
    DISABLED --> ADJUSTING : re-enabled (with headroom)
    STOPPED --> DISABLED : switch turned off
    ACTIVE --> DISABLED : switch turned off
    ADJUSTING --> DISABLED : switch turned off
    RAMP_UP_HOLD --> DISABLED : switch turned off
```

---

### Diagnostic sensors

The integration provides several diagnostic sensors for monitoring and automation:

| Entity | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `sensor.*_balancer_state` | Diagnostic | Operational state: `stopped`, `active`, `adjusting`, `ramp_up_hold`, `disabled` |
| `sensor.*_configured_fallback` | Diagnostic | Configured unavailable behavior: `stop`, `ignore`, or `set_current` |
| `binary_sensor.*_meter_status` | Connectivity | **On** = power meter reporting valid readings. **Off** = unavailable. |
| `binary_sensor.*_fallback_active` | Problem | **On** = meter-unavailable fallback in effect. **Off** = normal operation. |

Together these sensors answer: *What is the balancer doing? Is my meter working? What fallback did I configure? Is that fallback active right now?*

For detailed logging and diagnostics, see the [Logging Guide](docs/documentation/logging-guide.md).

---

### Home Assistant restart

All entity states (sensors, numbers, switch) survive a restart because each entity uses Home Assistant's **RestoreEntity** mechanism. On startup:

1. Sensors restore their last known values (`current_set`, `available_current`).
2. Number entities restore their runtime parameters (`max_charger_current`, `min_ev_current`).
3. The switch restores its `enabled` state.
4. The `current_set` sensor syncs its restored value back into the coordinator so the balancing algorithm continues from where it left off — no spike or drop.
5. The coordinator starts listening for power-meter state changes. The next meter event triggers a normal recomputation.

> **Note:** Between restart completion and the first power meter event, the charger current stays at the last known value. No action is taken until fresh meter data arrives.

---

### Power meter unavailable

When the power meter entity transitions to `unavailable` or `unknown`, the coordinator can no longer compute headroom. The behavior is controlled by the **"When power meter is unavailable"** config setting:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **Stop charging** (default) | Charger is immediately set to 0 A — safest option when meter data is unreliable. |
| **Ignore** | Do nothing — keep the last computed charger current. Useful if brief meter dropouts are common and you don't want to interrupt charging. |
| **Set a specific current** | Apply the configured fallback current, **capped at the charger maximum**. This ensures the fallback never exceeds the physical charger limit. For example: if max charger current is 32 A and the fallback is 50 A, the charger is set to 32 A; if the fallback is 6 A, the charger drops to 6 A. |

When the meter recovers and starts reporting valid values again, normal computation resumes automatically on the next state change.

> **Tip:** The `binary_sensor.*_meter_status` and `binary_sensor.*_fallback_active` sensors let you monitor meter health and fallback activation in dashboards and automations without enabling debug logs. The `sensor.*_configured_fallback` sensor shows which fallback mode is currently configured.

> **Note:** The EV charger device itself is not monitored by this integration. The integration only controls the *target current* it sends; it does not track whether the charger is physically connected or responding. Charger health monitoring is the responsibility of the charger integration (e.g., OCPP).

---

### Multi-charger fairness — planned feature

> ⚠️ **Not yet implemented.** Multi-charger support with per-charger prioritization/weighting is planned for Phase 2 (post-MVP). See [`docs/documentation/milestones/02-2026-02-19-multi-charger-plan.md`](docs/documentation/milestones/02-2026-02-19-multi-charger-plan.md) for the Phase 2 plan. The water-filling algorithm is already unit-tested in `tests/test_load_balancer.py` and will feed into that work.

When multiple chargers are active the available current will be distributed fairly using a water-filling algorithm:

```
Available current pool
────────────────────────────────────────────
   Charger A (max 10 A)  │  Charger B (max 32 A)
   ───────────────────── │  ──────────────────────
   fair share = pool / N │  fair share = pool / N
                         │
   if share ≥ max A      │  gets share
   → cap at 10 A         │
   → unused headroom     │
     returned to pool    │
────────────────────────────────────────────
   Remaining pool re-divided across uncapped chargers
```

1. Divide the pool equally among all active chargers.
2. Chargers that reach their per-charger maximum are capped; the surplus is returned to the pool.
3. Chargers whose share would fall below `min_ev_a` are stopped; they leave the pool.
4. Repeat until all remaining chargers have a valid fair share.

### Running CI checks locally

**Linting** (requires `ruff`):
```bash
pip install ruff
ruff check .
```

**Type checking** (requires `pyright`):
```bash
pip install pyright
pyright
```

**Spell checking** (requires `codespell`):
```bash
pip install codespell
codespell
```

These tools read their configuration from `pyrightconfig.json` (Pyright) and `pyproject.toml` (Ruff and codespell) at the repo root.

**Secret scanning** (requires [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)):
```bash
# macOS
brew install gitleaks
# or download a release binary from https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases

gitleaks detect --source . --config .gitleaks.toml
```
To suppress a confirmed false positive on a specific line, append `# gitleaks:allow` to that line.
For path-level suppressions, add the path regex to the `paths` array under the `[allowlist]` table in `.gitleaks.toml`.

**Dependency Review**: this check is GitHub-only and runs automatically on every pull request — no local tooling is required.
