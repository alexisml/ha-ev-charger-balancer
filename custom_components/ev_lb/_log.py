"""Centralized logging for the EV Charger Load Balancing integration.

All modules import their logger from here instead of calling
``logging.getLogger(__name__)`` directly.  This gives us a single place
to change the logging behaviour in the future (e.g. structured output,
rate-limiting, or additional context) without touching every module.

Usage::

    from ._log import get_logger

    _LOGGER = get_logger(__name__)

    Thin wrapper so every module in the integration obtains its logger
    from one place.  If we ever need to inject extra context, apply
    rate-limiting, or switch to structured logging, we only change this
    function.
