"""Pure computation functions for EV charger dynamic load balancing.

This module contains the core balancing logic used by the integration
runtime.  It has no dependency on Home Assistant — it can be tested
with plain pytest.

Functions:
    compute_available_current   — max EV current given a non-EV power draw
    compute_target_current      — full single-charger target from service meter (amps)
    clamp_current               — per-charger min/max/step clamping
    distribute_current          — equal water-filling distribution across N chargers
    distribute_current_weighted — weighted water-filling distribution across N chargers
    apply_ramp_up_limit         — cooldown before allowing current increase
    clamp_to_safe_output        — defense-in-depth output safety clamp
    resolve_balancer_state      — operational state string from balancer conditions
    resolve_fallback_current    — fallback current when power meter is unavailable
    compute_fallback_reapply    — adjusted fallback after charger parameter changes

    Maps the configured unavailable-behavior mode to the appropriate current
    value.  The caller is responsible for any associated logging or
    notifications.

    Behavior modes (``UNAVAILABLE_BEHAVIOR_*`` constants in ``const.py``):

    - ``"ignore"``      — keep the last balanced value unchanged (returns ``None``
                          as a sentinel so the caller can skip the update entirely).
    - ``"set_current"`` — apply the configured fallback, capped at the charger max.
    - ``"stop"`` (or any unrecognised value) — stop charging (0 A).

    Args:
        behavior:     The configured unavailable-behavior mode string.
        fallback_a:   The configured fallback current in Amps (used by
                      ``"set_current"`` mode only).
        max_charger_a: Per-charger hardware maximum in Amps.
