"""Pure computation functions for EV charger dynamic load balancing.

This module contains the core logic that will be ported into the custom
Home Assistant integration (custom_components/ev_lb/).  It has no
dependency on AppDaemon, Home Assistant, or any external runtime —
it can be tested with plain pytest.

Functions:
    compute_available_current   — headroom above current total draw
    clamp_current               — per-charger min/max/step clamping
    distribute_current          — water-filling distribution across N chargers
    apply_ramp_up_limit         — cooldown before allowing current increase

    The formula converts the total metered house power (including any active
