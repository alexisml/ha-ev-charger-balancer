"""Tests for the charger status sensor feature.

When a charger status sensor is configured the balancer reads its state to
determine whether the EV is actively drawing current.  If the sensor reports
a state other than 'Charging', the EV draw estimate is zeroed so the
balancer does not over-subtract headroom when the charger is idle.

Covers:
- Available headroom is not over-subtracted when EV is not charging
- Available headroom correctly accounts for EV draw when sensor = Charging
- Behaviour is unchanged when no status sensor is configured
- Status sensor set via the options flow is honoured by the coordinator
- EV throttling (battery near full) does not lock coordinator at max amps
- ev_charging diagnostic sensor reflects charger status changes
- ev_charging sensor stays on when status sensor is unavailable/unknown
- ev_charging sensor is always on when no status sensor is configured
- coordinator.ev_charging attribute is updated correctly on each recompute
- ev_charging diagnostic updates immediately on status change (no meter event needed)
- ev_charging diagnostic is initialized from the charger status state at startup (hot-load path)
- ev_charging diagnostic is initialized from the charger status state during HA boot (boot path)
