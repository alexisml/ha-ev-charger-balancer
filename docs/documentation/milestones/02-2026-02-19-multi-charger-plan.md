Status: in-review
Summary: Phase 2 plan for adding multi-charger support with per-charger priority-based current distribution. Refined 2026-03-10 to fix the priority model, input/output contract, and tie-breaking rules.

---

This document covers Phase 2 of the integration — multi-charger support. Phase 2 begins after the MVP (Phase 1) is released and stable. See the MVP plan: [`01-2026-02-19-mvp-plan.md`](01-2026-02-19-mvp-plan.md).

## Goal

Extend the single-charger integration to support N EV chargers sharing the same service connection. Available current is distributed across all configured chargers **proportionally to their priority values**, always maximising the total current delivered. Each charger is configured independently with its own scripts, limits, and priority.

> **Example:** 100 A of available headroom across three chargers with priorities 50, 30, and 20 → those chargers receive 50 A, 30 A, and 20 A respectively.

## Inputs and outputs

### Per-power-meter inputs (shared across all chargers on the same meter)

| Input | Description |
|---|---|
| `power_meter_entity` | HA sensor that reports the **total** service power draw in Watts |
| `voltage` | Nominal supply voltage in Volts |
| `max_service_current` | Service breaker / fuse rating in Amps — hard ceiling for the entire site |
| `unavailable_behavior` | What to do when the power meter is unavailable: `stop` stops all chargers (0 A); `ignore` keeps the last commanded current on all chargers; `set_current` applies each charger's own `unavailable_fallback_current` — set a charger's fallback to `0` to stop that charger while others continue at their configured fallback. |

### Per-charger inputs (configured per charger)

| Input | Description |
|---|---|
| `action_set_current` | HA script entity called to command the charger current (receives `current_a` variable) |
| `action_start_charging` | HA script entity called to start a charging session |
| `action_stop_charging` | HA script entity called to stop a charging session |
| `charger_status_entity` | Optional HA sensor that reports the charger state (e.g. `"Charging"`) |
| `max_charger_current` | Per-charger hard ceiling in Amps — the charger will never be commanded above this |
| `min_ev_current` | Minimum usable current in Amps — below this the charger is stopped rather than throttled |
| `unavailable_fallback_current` | Fallback current (Amps) commanded to this charger when `unavailable_behavior` is `set_current`. Set to `0` to stop this charger when the meter is unavailable. |
| `priority` | Integer from 0 to 100 (multiples of 5). Determines this charger's proportional share of available current. Higher value = larger share. |
| `charger_index` | Zero-based position within the power meter's charger group — unique per group, used as a tie-breaker when two chargers share equal priority |
| `ramp_up_time_s` | Stability window in seconds (default 15 s, range 5–300 s). Available headroom must remain continuously above the current commanded level for this duration before the next ramp-up step is allowed. |
| `ramp_up_step_a` | Maximum current increase per stability period in Amps (default 4 A, range 1–32 A). The commanded current rises by at most this amount each time the stability window elapses. Smaller values give more gradual recovery; larger values reach full current in fewer steps. |

### Per-charger outputs (computed per cycle, exposed as HA entities)

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `current_set_a` | Current most recently commanded to this charger in Amps |
| `current_set_w` | Same, converted to Watts |
| `allocated_current_a` | This charger's proportional share of the site's available headroom after surplus redistribution. Normally equals `current_set_a`; differs when ramp-up hold or idle clamp reduces the commanded current below the allocated share — useful for diagnosing why this charger is running below its allocated headroom. |
| `ramp_up_next_step_a` | The next ramp-up step size (Amps) that will be applied when the stability window next elapses. `0` when ramp-up is not active. |
| `balancer_state` | Operational state string: `stopped`, `active`, `adjusting`, `ramp_up_hold`, `disabled` |
| `ev_charging` | Boolean — whether the charger reports that an EV is actively charging |
| `last_action_reason` | Why the last command was issued |
| `last_action_error` | Error message from the most recent failed action script call |
| `last_action_timestamp` | UTC timestamp of the most recent action script call |
| `last_action_status` | `success` or `failure` |
| `action_latency_ms` | Round-trip time for the most recent action call in milliseconds |

## Priority model

### Priority field

- Configurable per charger as an integer from **0 to 100**, in **steps of 5**.
- Default: `50` (neutral — equal footing with other default-priority chargers).
- Higher value = higher preference when headroom is scarce.

### Distribution algorithm

The balancer runs once per power-meter update cycle. The algorithm is:

1. **Compute site headroom** — same formula as the single-charger MVP:
   ```
   total_ev_a        = sum of current_set_a for chargers where ev_charging is true
                       (chargers at idle clamp with no active EV draw are excluded)
   service_w         = power from power_meter_entity (W)
   service_current_a = service_w / voltage
   non_ev_a          = max(0, service_current_a − total_ev_a)
   available_a       = max_service_current − non_ev_a
   ```

2. **Proportional allocation** — allocate current to each charger in proportion to its priority value:
   ```
   priority_sum    = sum of priority for all active chargers
   if priority_sum > 0:
       share_a     = available_a × (charger_priority / priority_sum)
   else:
       # All active chargers have priority 0 → treat them as equal priority
       active_count = number of active chargers
       share_a      = available_a / active_count
   ```
   Clamp each share to `min(share_a, max_charger_current)`.

3. **Stop chargers below minimum** — if a charger's allocated share falls below its `min_ev_current`, set that charger's allocation to `0` (stop charging) and exclude it from the priority sum. **Tie-break sub-step:** when two or more equal-priority chargers all fall below `min_ev_current` but `available_a` is enough to run exactly one of them at `min_ev_current`:
   1. Assign `min_ev_current` to the charger with the lowest `charger_index` in the tied group.
   2. Subtract `min_ev_current` from `available_a`.
   3. Stop all other chargers in the tied group (allocation set to `0`).
   4. Continue redistribution with the updated `available_a` and remaining active chargers.

4. **Redistribute surplus** — headroom freed by capped chargers (allocated at `max_charger_current` with remaining surplus) or stopped chargers (allocation set to `0`) is redistributed proportionally to the remaining active chargers. Repeat steps 2–4 until the allocations stabilise.

5. **Stepped ramp-up and idle clamp** — applied per charger independently after allocations are finalised:

   **Stepped ramp-up:** Each charger tracks its own `_ramp_up_armed` flag and `_headroom_stable_since` timestamp.
   - When **not armed** (initial start, no prior reduction): the charger jumps directly to its allocated target without waiting for any stability window.
   - When **armed** (after any reduction or EV-start event): the current may only increase once available headroom has been continuously above the current commanded level for `ramp_up_time_s` seconds.  Each time the stability window elapses, the commanded current rises by at most `ramp_up_step_a` toward the target; the stability timer then resets so the next step also requires a full window.
   - **First-step guard:** when `current_set_a < min_ev_current`, the effective step is extended to `max(ramp_up_step_a, min_ev_current − current_set_a)` so the first step always reaches at least `min_ev_current`, preventing an endless start/stop loop.
   - Reductions are always instant — the stability timer is cleared on any downward command.

   **Idle clamp:** unchanged from the MVP single-charger logic — when the status sensor reports the EV is not actively charging, the charger's commanded current is capped at `min_ev_current`.

**Example:** 100 A available, chargers with priority 50 / 30 / 20 → allocations are 50 A / 30 A / 20 A. If the 50-priority charger is capped at 40 A, the remaining 10 A is split 30:20 → the other two chargers receive 36 A and 24 A.

### Tie-breaking rule

When two or more chargers share the same priority **and available headroom is insufficient to bring more than one charger up to `min_ev_current`**, only the charger with the **lowest `charger_index`** (i.e. the first charger added during configuration) receives current. All other same-priority chargers are stopped.

### Maximise charging principle

The algorithm never withholds current from chargers that can use it. Surplus freed by a charger that is capped at its `max_charger_current` or stopped below `min_ev_current` is always redistributed proportionally to the remaining active chargers. Headroom is only left unused when no remaining charger can accept even `min_ev_current`.
