Summary: Phase 2 plan for adding multi-charger support with per-charger prioritization and weighted current distribution.

---

This document covers Phase 2 of the integration — multi-charger support. Phase 2 begins after the MVP (Phase 1) is released and stable. See the MVP plan: [`01-2026-02-19-mvp-plan.md`](01-2026-02-19-mvp-plan.md).

## Goal

Extend the single-charger integration to support multiple EV chargers sharing the same service connection, with configurable per-charger priority or weight to control how available current is distributed between them.

## Design decisions (made during implementation)

- **Priority as integer weight 0–100 in steps of 5**: shown as a slider in the HA options UI; relative values matter (e.g. 60/40 distributes 60% to charger 1 and 40% to charger 2). Equal values = equal distribution. A priority of 0 effectively stops that charger (its share is 0, which falls below min_a).
- **Dynamic N chargers via a single re-entrant `charger` step**: The options flow uses one `async_step_charger` handler that loops back to itself via `description_placeholders` (injecting the charger number into the step description). The "add another charger?" toggle drives the loop; `MAX_CHARGERS` in `const.py` is the only cap. Raising the limit only requires changing that constant — no new step handlers or `strings.json` entries are needed. This replaces the previous fixed `charger_1` / `charger_2` / `charger_3` approach.
- **Runtime charger management via the options flow**: After initial setup, chargers can be added, modified, or removed at any time through the **Configure** dialog (no HA restart required):
  - *Modify*: each charger step is pre-filled with the current saved values; update only the fields that require changes.
  - *Remove*: step through to the last charger you want to keep and do **not** tick "Add another charger?" — later chargers are dropped.
  - *Add*: tick "Add another charger?" on the last configured charger to configure an additional one (up to `MAX_CHARGERS`).
  The `_existing_charger_defaults` helper in the options flow reads from `CONF_CHARGERS` (new format) or the legacy flat keys, so pre-fill works correctly for both old and new entries.
- **Backward compat via flat-key fallback**: existing single-charger config entries are automatically detected in `_load_chargers()` (no `CONF_CHARGERS` key present → single charger from flat keys). Users who never enable multi-charger mode see no change.
- **Weighted water-filling algorithm** (`distribute_current_weighted` in `load_balancer.py`): iterative, handles capping and min-current stop conditions with weight re-normalisation on each round. When all weights are equal, produces identical results to the existing `distribute_current` function.
- **Per-charger ramp-up tracking**: each `_ChargerState` holds its own `last_reduction_time` to ensure ramp-up cooldown applies independently per charger.

## Milestones

| PR milestone | Scope | Exit criteria | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| PR-1-ph2: Multi-charger data model | Extend config/options flow to support multiple chargers; add per-charger weight/priority field. | Multiple chargers can be configured; each has a stable unique ID and a configurable weight; entity/device links are correct. | ✅ done |
| PR-2-ph2: Weighted current distribution engine | Implement weighted distribution algorithm replacing the single-charger computation; port or replace existing `distribute_current` logic. | Available current is allocated proportionally to charger weights; capped and stopped chargers correctly redistribute surplus; all edge cases covered by unit tests. | ✅ done |
| PR-3-ph2: Runtime charger management | Add options flow for adding/removing chargers and updating weights at runtime without HA restart. | Chargers can be added/removed and weights changed at runtime; entities/device links remain consistent; options-flow integration tests pass. | ✅ done (via options flow multi-step) |
| PR-4-ph2: Per-charger entities + test stabilization | Add per-charger sensor entities; complete integration tests for multi-charger scenarios; update docs. | CI green, multi-charger configuration documented, release notes updated. | pending |

> **Note on PR-4-ph2**: Sensor entities currently report the *aggregate* across all chargers (sum of currents). Per-charger sensors (e.g. `sensor.ev_lb_charger_1_current_set`) are deferred to PR-4-ph2 so that the data model and coordinator are stable first.

## Global quality gates

- Add/update unit tests for every behavior introduced in each milestone.
- Keep the CI workflow green on every PR before merge.
- Include a short "how to test" section in each PR description.
