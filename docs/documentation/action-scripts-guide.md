# Action Scripts Guide

This guide explains how to configure the **action scripts** that allow the EV Charger Load Balancing integration to control your physical charger.

## Overview

The integration computes the optimal charging current based on your household power consumption. To actually _control_ your charger, it needs scripts that translate these decisions into commands for your specific charger hardware (e.g., OCPP, Modbus, REST API, etc.).

Three action scripts can be configured:

| Action | When it fires | Variables passed |
|---|---|---|
| **Set current** | When the target charging current changes | `current_a` (float), `charger_id` (string) |
| **Stop charging** | When headroom drops below the minimum and charging must stop | `charger_id` (string) |
| **Start charging** | When charging can resume after being stopped | `charger_id` (string) |

All actions are **optional**. If no scripts are configured, the integration operates in "compute-only" mode — it calculates and displays the target current via sensor entities, but does not send commands to any charger.

---

## Variables reference

Every script receives variables automatically. You can reference them in your script's action sequences using template syntax (e.g., `{{ current_a }}`).

### `set_current` script variables

| Variable | Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `current_a` | `float` | Target charging current in Amps, floored to 1 A steps | `16.0` |
| `charger_id` | `string` | Unique identifier for the charger (config entry ID) | `abc123def456` |

### `stop_charging` script variables

| Variable | Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `charger_id` | `string` | Unique identifier for the charger | `abc123def456` |

### `start_charging` script variables

| Variable | Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `charger_id` | `string` | Unique identifier for the charger | `abc123def456` |

> **Note:** The `charger_id` is the Home Assistant config entry ID. In the current single-charger MVP it uniquely identifies the one configured charger. In a future multi-charger version, each charger will have its own ID.

---

## Creating scripts

### Step 1: Create the scripts in Home Assistant

Go to **Settings → Automations & Scenes → Scripts → + Add Script**.

#### Example: `set_current` script for OCPP

Create a script named `ev_lb_set_current`:

```yaml
alias: EV LB - Set Current
description: Set the EV charger current limit via OCPP
mode: single
fields:
  current_a:
    description: Target charging current in Amps
    example: 16.0
    selector:
      number:
        min: 0
        max: 80
        step: 1
        unit_of_measurement: A
  charger_id:
    description: Charger identifier
    example: "abc123"
    selector:
      text:
sequence:
  - action: ocpp.set_charge_rate
    data:
      limit_amps: "{{ current_a }}"
```

#### Example: `stop_charging` script for OCPP

Create a script named `ev_lb_stop_charging`:

```yaml
alias: EV LB - Stop Charging
description: Stop EV charging via OCPP
mode: single
fields:
  charger_id:
    description: Charger identifier
    selector:
      text:
sequence:
  - action: ocpp.set_charge_rate
    data:
      limit_amps: 0
```

#### Example: `start_charging` script for OCPP

Create a script named `ev_lb_start_charging`:

```yaml
alias: EV LB - Start Charging
description: Resume EV charging via OCPP
mode: single
fields:
  charger_id:
    description: Charger identifier
    selector:
      text:
sequence:
  - action: ocpp.reset
    data: {}
```

> **Tip:** The exact service calls depend on your charger integration. The examples above use the [lbbrhzn/ocpp](https://github.com/lbbrhzn/ocpp) integration. Replace the `ocpp.*` actions with whatever services your charger integration exposes.

### Step 2: Configure in the integration

#### During initial setup

When adding the integration (Settings → Integrations → Add → EV Charger Load Balancing), you'll see optional fields for each action script. Select the scripts you created from the dropdown.

#### After initial setup (Options flow)

You can add, change, or remove action scripts at any time:

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations → EV Charger Load Balancing**.
2. Click **Configure**.
3. Update the action script selections.
4. Click **Submit**.

The integration will reload automatically with the new configuration.

## Transition logic

The integration tracks charger state and fires actions only when a transition occurs:

| Previous state | New state | Actions fired |
|---|---|---|
| **Stopped** (0 A) | **Charging** (> 0 A) | `start_charging` → `set_current(current_a)` |
| **Charging** (X A) | **Stopped** (0 A) | `stop_charging` |
| **Charging** (X A) | **Charging** (Y A, Y ≠ X) | `set_current(current_a)` |
| **Stopped** (0 A) | **Stopped** (0 A) | _(no action)_ |
| **Charging** (X A) | **Charging** (X A) | _(no action)_ |

### Resume sequence

When charging resumes after being stopped, `start_charging` is called **before** `set_current`. This ensures the charger is ready to accept current before a target is set. Both calls are `blocking: true`, so `set_current` waits for `start_charging` to complete.

---

## Error handling

- **Script not configured:** The action is silently skipped. No error is logged.
- **Script call fails:** A warning is logged, but the integration continues operating. Other actions are not affected — for example, if `start_charging` fails, `set_current` will still be attempted.
- **Script entity does not exist:** Treated as a call failure — a warning is logged and the integration continues.

---

## Can I use an action directly instead of a script?

Currently, the integration requires **script entities** (created in Settings → Automations & Scenes → Scripts). This was chosen because:

1. **Script entities provide a UI-friendly dropdown** — you pick from a list rather than typing service names and data manually.
2. **Scripts can contain multiple steps** — a single "set current" action might need to call multiple services, add delays, or include conditions.
3. **Scripts are reusable** — the same script can be called by automations, the integration, or manually from the Developer Tools.

Direct inline action configuration (like automation action sequences) may be considered for a future version. For now, creating scripts is the recommended approach and provides the same flexibility since scripts support all HA action types (service calls, delays, conditions, etc.).

---

## Adapting for different charger integrations

The scripts are the bridge between this integration and your specific charger. Here are some common patterns:

### OCPP chargers (lbbrhzn/ocpp)

```yaml
# set_current
- action: ocpp.set_charge_rate
  data:
    limit_amps: "{{ current_a }}"

# stop_charging
- action: ocpp.set_charge_rate
  data:
    limit_amps: 0

# start_charging
- action: ocpp.reset
  data: {}
```

### REST API chargers

```yaml
# set_current
- action: rest_command.set_charger_current
  data:
    current: "{{ current_a }}"

# stop_charging
- action: rest_command.stop_charger

# start_charging
- action: rest_command.start_charger
```

### Modbus chargers

```yaml
# set_current
- action: modbus.write_register
  data:
    hub: charger
    unit: 1
    address: 100
    value: "{{ (current_a * 10) | int }}"
```

### Generic switch-based chargers

```yaml
# stop_charging
- action: switch.turn_off
  target:
    entity_id: switch.ev_charger

# start_charging
- action: switch.turn_on
  target:
    entity_id: switch.ev_charger
```

> **Note:** For switch-based chargers, `set_current` may not be applicable if the charger doesn't support current limiting. In that case, only configure `stop_charging` and `start_charging`.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Actions are not firing

1. Check that the script entities exist in **Developer Tools → Services**.
2. Verify the scripts are selected in the integration config (Settings → Integrations → EV Charger Load Balancing → Configure).
3. Check the Home Assistant logs for warnings about failed actions.

### Actions fire but charger doesn't respond

1. Test the scripts manually from **Developer Tools → Services** by calling `script.turn_on` with the appropriate variables.
2. Verify your charger integration is working independently.
3. Check the charger integration's logs for errors.

### How to find the charger_id

The `charger_id` is the config entry ID, visible in the Home Assistant URL when you view the integration:
`/config/integrations/integration/ev_lb#<charger_id>`

You can also find it in **Developer Tools → States** by searching for any `ev_lb` entity and checking its `unique_id` prefix.
