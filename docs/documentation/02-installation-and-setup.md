# Installation & Setup

This guide walks you through installing the integration, configuring it for the first time, and verifying that everything is working.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Home Assistant 2023.6 or later** (Core, OS, or Container install)
- **[HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) 2.0 or later** for installing the integration
- **A power meter sensor** — any `sensor.*` entity in Home Assistant that reports your total service power in Watts
- **An EV charger you can control** — via [lbbrhzn/ocpp](https://github.com/lbbrhzn/ocpp), Modbus, REST API, or any charger controllable through Home Assistant scripts

> **Don't have a controllable charger?** The integration can still run in "compute-only" mode — it calculates the optimal charging current and exposes it as a sensor, but does not send any commands. You can use this to test, prototype dashboards, or build your own automations around the computed value.

---

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

1. Open **HACS → Integrations → ⋮ (three dots) → Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/alexisml/ha-ev-charger-balancer` as an **Integration**.
3. Search for **Watt-O-Balancer** and click **Download**.
4. **Restart Home Assistant** — the integration won't appear until you restart.

### Manual installation

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Copy the `custom_components/ev_lb/` folder into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory.
3. **Restart Home Assistant.**

After installation, the integration is available in **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.

## Configuration

### Step-by-step initial setup

```mermaid

    A["Settings → Devices<br/>& Services"] --> B["Add Integration"]
    B --> C["Search: EV Charger<br/>Load Balancing"]
    C --> D["Fill in config form<br/>(meter, voltage, service current)"]
    D --> E{"Action scripts?"}
    E -- "Yes" --> F["Select scripts<br/>(set current, stop, start)"]
    E -- "Skip" --> G["Submit"]
    F --> G
    G --> H(["Device + entities<br/>created ✅"])
```

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
2. Search for **Watt-O-Balancer** and select it.
3. You'll see a configuration form. Here's what each field means:

#### Required fields

| Field | What it is | What to enter | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Power meter sensor** | The sensor that reports your total service power in Watts. This is the main input the integration uses to compute available headroom. | Select any `sensor.*` entity that reports power in W. This is typically your main electricity meter, a CT clamp sensor, or a smart meter integration. | *(required — no default)* |
| **Supply voltage** | Your nominal mains voltage. Used to convert between Watts and Amps. The integration assumes a **single-phase** supply. For three-phase installations, see [Single-phase assumption and multi-phase installations](03-how-it-works.md#single-phase-assumption-and-multi-phase-installations). | Enter `230` for most of Europe, `240` for UK/Australia, or `120` for North America. | `230` V |
| **Max service current** | Your service current limit. The integration will **never** allow total consumption to exceed this. You can set this **lower than your actual breaker rating** to keep a permanent safety margin — for example, enter 28 A on a 32 A service to always reserve 4 A for other loads. It can also represent a subcircuit or any custom power budget. | Check your main breaker or electrical panel. Common values: 25 A, 32 A, 40 A, 63 A. | `32` A |
| **When power meter is unavailable** | What should happen if your power meter sensor stops reporting (goes `unavailable` or `unknown`). | Choose one of three options — see below. | `Stop charging` |

#### Unavailable behavior options

| Option | What it does | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| **Stop charging** (default) | Immediately sets charger current to 0 A. Safest option. | Recommended for most users. If you can't measure power, you can't safely balance. |
| **Ignore (keep last value)** | Keeps the last computed charging current unchanged. | If your meter has frequent brief dropouts and you don't want charging interrupted every time. |
| **Set a specific current** | Applies a fixed fallback current (configured below), capped at the charger maximum. | If you want a safe-but-non-zero charging rate as a fallback. |

| Field | What it is | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Fallback current** | The current to use when meter is unavailable and mode is "Set a specific current". Always capped at the charger maximum — even if you enter 50 A and your charger max is 32 A, it will use 32 A. | `6` A |

#### Optional fields — action scripts and charger status sensor

These are **optional**. If you skip them, the integration runs in compute-only mode (sensors only, no charger commands).

| Field | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Set current action** | A script entity that the integration calls to set the charging current on your charger. Receives `current_a` (float) and `charger_id` (string) as variables. |
| **Stop charging action** | A script entity called to stop charging when there's not enough headroom. Receives `charger_id` (string). |
| **Start charging action** | A script entity called to resume charging after it was stopped. Receives `charger_id` (string). |
| **Charger status sensor** | A sensor entity whose state equals `Charging` when the EV is actively drawing current. When configured, the balancer avoids over-subtracting headroom while the charger is idle or finished. If you use the [lbbrhzn/ocpp](https://github.com/lbbrhzn/ocpp) integration, use `sensor.*_status_connector`. See [Charger status sensor](03-how-it-works.md#charger-status-sensor-optional) for details. |

> **New to action scripts?** See the [Action Scripts Guide](04-action-scripts-guide.md) for step-by-step instructions on creating scripts for OCPP, REST, Modbus, or switch-based chargers.

4. Click **Submit**. The integration creates a device called **EV Charger Load Balancer** and all its entities immediately.

### Changing settings after setup

Almost all settings can be changed at any time via the **Configure** dialog — no need to delete and re-add the integration.

#### What you can change

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Watt-O-Balancer**.
2. Click the **Configure** button (gear icon).
3. Adjust any of the following and click **Submit**. The integration reloads automatically.

| Setting | Changeable via Configure? |
|---|---|
| Supply voltage | ✅ Yes |
| Max service current | ❌ **No** — adjust via `number.*_max_service_current` on the device page (see note below) |
| When power meter is unavailable | ✅ Yes |
| Fallback current | ✅ Yes |
| Set current action script | ✅ Yes |
| Stop charging action script | ✅ Yes |
| Start charging action script | ✅ Yes |
| Charger status sensor | ✅ Yes |
| **Power meter sensor** | ❌ **No** — see below |

> **Adjusting the service limit:** Use the `number.*_max_service_current` entity on the device page to raise or lower the service current limit at any time. The new value is applied immediately using the most recent power-meter reading — no integration reload needed. If the power meter is currently unavailable, the new limit is still saved and will take effect as soon as meter data resumes, with interim behavior following your **When power meter is unavailable** setting. Changes persist across HA restarts (the value is saved in the HA state cache).

#### Changing the power meter sensor

The power meter sensor **cannot** be changed after setup. It acts as the unique identifier for the config entry — Home Assistant uses it internally to prevent duplicate instances and to track the integration across restarts.

To switch to a different power meter sensor, you must **delete the integration and re-add it**:

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Watt-O-Balancer**.
2. Click the three dots (⋮) → **Delete**.
3. Add the integration again and select the new sensor during setup.

## Verifying your setup

After configuration, check that everything is working:

1. **Go to Settings → Devices → EV Charger Load Balancer.** You should see all entities listed under this device.

2. **Check the key sensors:**
   - `sensor.*_available_current` — should show a value in Amps (this is how much headroom your electrical service has for EV charging right now).
   - `sensor.*_balancer_state` — should show `stopped` (if available current is below minimum) or `active`/`adjusting` (if there's enough headroom).
   - `binary_sensor.*_power_meter_status` — should be **On** (meter is reporting data).

3. **Test the reaction:** If you have action scripts configured, try changing your service load (turn on a high-power appliance like a kettle or oven) and watch the `sensor.*_charging_current_set` value change in real time.

> **Tip:** You can also check **Developer Tools → States** and filter by `ev_lb` to see all entity states at a glance.

## Removing the integration

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Watt-O-Balancer**.
2. Click the three dots (⋮) → **Delete**.
3. All entities and the device are removed. Your charger is left at whatever current was last set — the integration does not send a "reset" command on removal.
