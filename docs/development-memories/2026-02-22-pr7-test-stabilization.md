Title: PR-7-MVP — Test stabilization + HACS release readiness
Date: 2026-02-22
Author: copilot
Status: in-review
Summary: Finalizes HACS requirements, adds restore-entity tests, and fixes manifest URLs for release readiness.

---

## Context

PR-7-MVP is the final stabilization milestone before the integration can be installed via HACS and used in production. The integration already had comprehensive test coverage (158 tests) across config flow, entities, balancing engine, action execution, event notifications, balancer state, logging, and the set_limit service. This PR addresses the remaining gaps: incorrect manifest URLs, missing restore-entity tests, and documentation updates.

## What changed

- **`custom_components/ev_lb/manifest.json`**: Fixed `documentation` and `issue_tracker` URLs — they pointed to `alexisml/ev-charger-load-balancing` instead of the correct `alexisml/ha-ev-charger-balancer`.
- **`tests/test_entity_initialization.py`** (new): Added 13 tests covering entity defaults on fresh setup, state restoration from cache (sensor, number, switch, binary sensor), coordinator sync, and unload/reload cycle.
- **`README.md`**: Updated status line from "working toward PR-7-MVP" to "PR-7-MVP complete; working toward PR-8-MVP: User manual".
- **`docs/documentation/milestones/01-2026-02-19-mvp-plan.md`**: Marked PR-7-MVP as ✅ Done.

## Design decisions

### 1. Entity initialization and restoration tests

The test file `test_entity_initialization.py` covers both fresh-setup defaults and actual state restoration from the HA restore cache. For `RestoreEntity` entities (switch, binary sensors), `mock_restore_cache` provides state data for `async_get_last_state()`. For `RestoreSensor` and `RestoreNumber` entities, `mock_restore_cache_with_extra_data` provides the extra stored data as a plain dict (not as a data class instance). The entity IDs used in the cache are deterministic, derived from the device name ("EV Charger Load Balancer") and the entity translation key.

### 2. Manifest URL fix

The `documentation` and `issue_tracker` URLs in `manifest.json` pointed to a non-existent repository (`ev-charger-load-balancing`). These were corrected to point to the actual repository (`ha-ev-charger-balancer`). HACS uses these URLs for the integration's info page and issue link.

### 3. No version bump

The version remains `0.1.0` as this is a pre-release stabilization milestone. A version bump to `1.0.0` should accompany the first HACS release tag, which will be created after the user manual (PR-8-MVP) is complete.

## Test coverage

After this PR, the test suite contains **171 tests** covering:

| Test module | Coverage area |
|---|---|
| `test_config_flow.py` | Config flow creation, validation, defaults, single-instance guard |
| `test_init.py` | Integration setup and unload |
| `test_entities.py` | Device registration, unique IDs, initial values, set-value, toggle, unload |
| `test_balancing_engine.py` | Target computation, overload, instant reduction, ramp-up, switch, unavailable modes |
| `test_action_execution.py` | Action payloads, transitions, error handling, options flow |
| `test_event_notifications.py` | HA events, persistent notifications, fault/resolution conditions |
| `test_balancer_state.py` | State sensor transitions, meter health, fallback, configured fallback |
| `test_logging.py` | Debug/info/warning log messages for all operational states |
| `test_set_limit_service.py` | Service registration, clamping, actions, one-shot override, lifecycle |
| `test_entity_initialization.py` | Entity defaults, state restoration from cache, coordinator sync, reload cycle |
| `test_load_balancer.py` | Pure logic: available current, clamping, distribution, ramp-up |
| `test_load_balancer.py` (extras) | Multi-charger distribution, step behavior, edge cases |

## Lessons learned

- Manifest URLs should be verified against the actual GitHub repository name early in the project — a mismatch breaks HACS discovery and issue reporting links.
- `mock_restore_cache_with_extra_data` expects extra data as a plain dict (`Mapping[str, Any]`), NOT as a data class instance. Passing `SensorExtraStoredData(...)` or `NumberExtraStoredData(...)` directly causes `from_dict` deserialization failures. Use `{"native_value": 16.0, ...}` instead.
- Entity IDs in `mock_restore_cache` must match the actual HA-generated entity IDs, which are derived from the device name and translation key (e.g., `switch.ev_charger_load_balancer_load_balancing_enabled`), NOT from the unique ID or config entry ID.

## What's next

- **PR-8-MVP: User manual** — Create a comprehensive end-user manual covering installation, configuration, usage, event notifications, action scripts, troubleshooting, and FAQ.
- After the user manual, create a tagged release (`v0.1.0` or `v1.0.0`) for HACS distribution.
